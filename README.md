Image Classification
This project focuses on creating an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras to distinguish images according to their label. The dataset consists of images with corresponding labels indicating their category.

Technologies Used
TensorFlow and Keras: Implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers for feature extraction from image data.
Scikit-learn: Utilized for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and metrics calculation.
NumPy and Pandas: Manipulated and processed data efficiently.
Matplotlib: Visualized model performance and explored the dataset.
XGBoost: Employed for comparison with traditional machine learning methods.

# Project Overview
Model Architecture: Designed a CNN with Conv2D, MaxPool2D, and Dense layers for effective feature extraction and classification.
Training: Compiled and trained the model using TensorFlow and Keras. Applied regularization techniques to enhance generalization.
Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance on a separate test set. Calculated accuracy and other relevant metrics.
XGBoost Comparison: Implemented an XGBoost classifier for benchmarking and compared its performance with the deep learning model.
Metrics: Utilized Scikit-learn metrics for evaluation, including mean absolute error and F1 score.
